                            Typists were responsible for producing letters, 
                            certificates, articles and other documentation. For a typist, making little to no 
                            errors was crucial. If too many errors on a document were made, the entire document 
                            had to be retyped.To be appointed as a typist by the Snowy Hydro Authority, applicants had to pass a 
                            40 words per minute typing test. <br><br>

                            made her eligible for a higher salary. Towards the end of her career, she was tested 
                            at 57.6 words per minute, a slight drop from her personal best!
