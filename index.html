                                        multiple research expeditions to Antarctica before he commenced work on the Snowy 
                                        Hydro project. Whilst working for the Snowy Hydro, he received the prestigious 
                                        Oswald Watt Medal. This medal recognizes “the most noticeable

                                A ‘Chainman’ is another name for someone who performs surveying work. Surveyors take

                                 as the construction of dams and hydroelectric power stations – is suitable.<br><br>
